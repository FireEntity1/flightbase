# Flightbase!

## Overview
An airline manager game where you grow your empire by purchasing aircraft, upgrades, and unlocking slots for various airports!

## How to play
Each aircraft has a base rate, the larger the aircraft, the larger the base rate. Additionally, unlocking airports will automatically send aircraft to the airport with the biggest multiplier, within its range. Larger/farther airports provide increasingly large multipliers, and only larger aircraft can fly there.

TL;DR: Buy aircraft, buy airport slots, make more money!

## Controls:
Simply use left click to interact with UI and use `escape` to quickly exit menus
